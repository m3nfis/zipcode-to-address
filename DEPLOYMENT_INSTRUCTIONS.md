# üöÄ Deployment Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to **https://github.com/new**
2. **Repository name**: `zipcode-to-address`
3. **Description**: `Lightning-fast postal code API with DuckDB and beautiful webapp`
4. **Visibility**: Public (required for free Render hosting)
5. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zipcode-to-address.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Render.com

### 3.1 Sign up/Login to Render
1. Go to **https://render.com**
2. Click **"Sign in with GitHub"**
3. Authorize Render to access your repositories

### 3.2 Create Web Service
1. Click **"New +"** ‚Üí **"Web Service"**
2. Connect your repository: **zipcode-to-address**
3. Click **"Connect"**

### 3.3 Configuration (Auto-detected from render.yaml)
Render will automatically detect our `render.yaml` file with these settings:
- **Name**: postal-code-lookup-api
- **Environment**: Node
- **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run setup && npm run ingest`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Node Version**: 22+

‚ö†Ô∏è **Free Tier Note**: Persistent disks are not supported on Render's free tier, so the database will be rebuilt on each deployment (takes 5-7 minutes).

### 3.4 Deploy
1. Click **"Create Web Service"**
2. Wait for deployment:
   - **Standard build**: 5-7 minutes (rebuilds database from scratch)
   - **Fast build**: 30 seconds (if using pre-built database - see Option 2 below)
3. Your API will be live at: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

## Step 4: Test Your Deployed API

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health

# Webapp
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/

# API examples
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/lookup?country=US&postalCode=90210
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/suggest?country=CA&partial=M5V
```

## Alternative: Fast Deployment (Optional)

For much faster deployments (30 seconds vs 5-7 minutes), you can upload your pre-built database and download it during deployment:

### Option 2A: Upload to GitHub Releases
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **"Releases"** ‚Üí **"Create a new release"**
3. Tag: `v1.0.0`, Title: `Database v1.0.0`
4. Upload your `data/postal_codes.duckdb` file (420MB)
5. Publish release
6. Update the `DATABASE_URL` in `scripts/download-prebuilt-db.js` with your release URL

### Option 2B: Use Fast Build
Update your render.yaml build command to:
```yaml
buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build-fast
```

This will try to download the pre-built database first, fall back to building if download fails.

## Important Notes

‚úÖ **Your project is ready for deployment!**
- Database will be created during build process
- 5M+ postal codes will be ingested automatically
- Webapp is fully functional with CSP compliance
- All dependencies are locked with package-lock.json

‚ö†Ô∏è **Free Tier Limitations:**
- Render free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- Upgrade to paid tier for always-on service

üîß **Environment Variables:**
No additional environment variables needed - everything works out of the box!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"disks are not supported for free tier services"**
- ‚úÖ Fixed in latest version - we removed the disk configuration
- The database now builds in ephemeral storage during deployment

**Build timeout during data ingestion:**
- Switch to Option 2 (fast deployment with pre-built database)
- Or upgrade to Render's paid tier for longer build times

**Database connection errors:**
- Ensure Node.js version is 22+ in build logs
- Check that all files are committed to GitHub
- Verify the build completed successfully

**App won't start:**
- Check runtime logs in Render dashboard
- Ensure PORT environment variable is set to 3000
- Verify health check endpoint `/health` is responding
